# ExcelInput

## Overview

**ExcelInput** is a specialized application developed at SoftIron to streamline and optimize the process of setting up feeders in machines that assemble hyperdrive components. Its main goal is to track and compare component usage across multiple projects, making it easier to identify reusable feeders and avoid redundant storage and setup.

Previously, feeders were returned to storage after each project with no record of which components were common across future projects. ExcelInput solves this by allowing users to compare Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) from multiple project files, making re-kitting and resource management more efficient.

## Features

- **Add Excel File:**  
  Easily add Excel files containing feeder/component information. The application stores both the file name (`FileName`) and its path (`FilePath`).

- **Remove Excel File:**  
  Remove any previously added Excel file using a dropdown list of all currently loaded files.

- **Select Excel File:**  
  Choose from a dropdown of added files to select the "base" file for comparison.

- **Multi-File Comparison:**  
  Select at least two files (the base file and one or more "next" files) to enable the **Complete** button. The application compares MPNs between the selected files.

- **Comparison Output:**  
  On pressing **Complete**, a new Excel file is generated. This file is a copy of the selected base file, with an added column named **Re-kit**. Each column in the new file shows the common MPNs between the base file and each of the selected next files.

- **View Result:**  
  After comparison, the **View** button is enabled, allowing users to view the newly created Excel file.

- **Reorder Selection:**  
  Use **Up** and **Down** buttons to change the sequence of selected files. These buttons are disabled after comparison is complete.

- **State Saving:**  
  Save the current state of the application and reopen it later to continue work without losing progress.

- **Help & Guidelines:**  
  A **Help** button provides users with detailed guidelines on how to use the application.
